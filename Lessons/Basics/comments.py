"""
    Sometimes, you want to document the code that you write. For example, you may want to note why a piece of code works. To do it, you use the comments.

    Typically, you use comments to explain formulas, algorithms, and complex business logic.

    When executing a program, the Python interpreter ignores the comments and only interprets the code.

    Python provides three kinds of comments including block comment, inline comment, and documentation string.

# Block comments


x = 10 # inline comments



# Python DocString
# Unlike a regular comment, a documentation string can be accessed at run-time using  obj.__doc__ attribute where obj is the name of the function.

# One line docstring vs Multi-line docstring
